When I’m fully immersed in a challenge  whether it's solving a tricky bug or designing an engaging user experience - I actually find a sense of calm and focus that I absolutely love. [[Tech gives me the perfect mix of creativity and logic.]]\nI thrive on digging into the details, being analytical and stubborn when needed, and seeing how every small piece contributes to something greater. Watching an idea grow from scratch into a functional, visual experience - where design, interactivity, and problem-solving meet - is pure magic to me.\nWith several years of experience in logistics, sales, and customer service, I’ve developed strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of how to work efficiently in fast-paced environments. [[This background has also given me a strong user-focused mindset - I always think about how things will feel and function for the end user.]] Now, I’m combining all those strengths in my journey into tech. Whether it’s writing code, creating accessible and responsive web interfaces, or simply learning something new."
